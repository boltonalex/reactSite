# reactSite

This is a repository for a portfolio page that I've built using ReactJs. You can view it at https://boltonalex.com.

I've used various tools from npm, but also a mixin from called <a href="https://github.com/josephfusco/angled-edges" target="_blank">angled-edges</a>.

The packages.json details all the tools that I've used, please feel free to dig around.
